How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the working directory has the files
the staging area has the files in which a logical change has been made i.e. the files which are to be commited(adding files which are changed)
this commits only those files with a logical change and not all the files
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
by using git diff--staged
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
