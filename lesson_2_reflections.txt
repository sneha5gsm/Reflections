What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when we intialise a repository we can use a version control system and create commits
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the working directory has the files
the staging area has the files in which a logical change has been made i.e. the files which are to be commited(adding files which are changed)
this commits only those files with a logical change and not all the files
