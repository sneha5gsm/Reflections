When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you might want to access your repository via another computer or when you want to have a backup
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so that you pull only the branches which you want since may other people also work and create commit.
