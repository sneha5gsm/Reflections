How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it compared the text in each line and found the lines with a difference
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you could add back the previous changes and compare with the existing copies/version
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
sometimesyou may not create a commit even though it is necessary and someties you may creae unnecessary create commits.On the other hand using google docs will create versions which may no t useful all the time and create a clutter
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because git was designed for code and since in code files are related toeach other ,chnges in one file may affect other files too
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives the list of commits starting from the latest
git diff compares two commits and gives the differences
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
previous versions without bugs are still saved


added to commit
